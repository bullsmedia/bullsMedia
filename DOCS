Hello. This document explains the layout of this code.

Table of Contents:
------------------
Background information
index.html
- Header / Navbar
- Hero image / What We Do
- Services Links
- Events list
- Volunteer form link
- Contact Us ie staff list


Background information
------------------
HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap CSS framework
HTML body is scroll locked such that each individual section is its
own scrollable element.
Anchors for internal linking have bottom margins to make room for the Navbar

Known issues:
- No smooth scroll on Safari


index.html
------------------
    Header
------------------
- Bootstrap Navbar
- Breaks at large breakpoint; links are in dropdown on small screens
- Social media links are boostrap icons
- Styles overridden in index.css

------------------
    Hero image / What We Do
------------------


------------------
    Services links
------------------
- Bootstrap container-fluid element as a single row.
- Each service is a column, the DJ service uses full width up top due to 
  popularity.
- Other services are column width 10 if the window is below large breakpoint,
  and column width 5 otherwise.
- Proper sizing is reliant on images inside the service being 901x383 or of
  equivalent aspect ratio.
- Image vanishes on hover to reveal text. User is assumed on desktop if above
  large breakpoint.
- If below large breakpoint, a mobile client is assumed and text is shown under
  the image as well, since hovering is impossible on mobile.

DJ Events: https://cglink.me/2k5/s50030
HYPE form: https://cglink.me/2k5/s50112
Room booking: https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/BullsMedia1@usfedu.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/


Known issues:
- Incorrect text rendering under image during hover transition on Safari

------------------
    Events list
------------------
Requires mysql or syntactical equivalent dbms with a database
"bullsmedia_events" with a table as follows

CREATE TABLE `events` (
 `name` varchar(50) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Name of the event',
 `physical_location` varchar(100) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Physical location of event, building and room no. preferred',
 `description` varchar(500) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Description of event',
 `start_time` datetime NOT NULL COMMENT 'Event start date & time',
 `end_time` datetime NOT NULL COMMENT 'Event end date & time',
 `img` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'Location of image for event, relative to index.html',
 `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
 PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=5 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4

Ensure PHP version > 7.0 and php-mysqli or equivalent is available.
- Function mysqli::fetch_all() used in backend code is not
  available in PHP versions less than 7.0
Ensure the credentials in events.php line 4 are correct and user webFetch has
SELECT access on table bullsmedia_events

Execution flow
- The full script is loaded, and at the end, eventsList.getEvents() is called.
- getEvents() is responsible for backend communication with the server
- The server returns an array object with nested arrays for each event in the
  table, and getEvents calls populateEvents with the returned data.
- populateEvents removes all elements inside the eventParent element. 
  "No Events Found" is displayed by default in the event the user has JS 
  disabled.
- For every array inside the eventArray object, a new parent div is created.
- Inside the parent div is a left and right section for formatting.
  - Left contains the start time of the event and its given image.
    - If the window size is less than the Bootstrap large breakpoint, the image
      is hidden.
  - Right contains the event name, physical location, and description.
    - If the window size is less than the Bootstrap large breakpoint, the
      description is hidden.
- After the left and right sections are finished, they are appended to the
  parent element.

Known issues
- Safari is unable to parse date given in the start variable. Possibly due to
  string representation using - instead of / e.g. 12-12-2020 while Safari expects
  12/12/2020

TODO
- format for mobile

------------------
    Volunteer form link
------------------

- Bootstrap container-fluid with and row as the parent
- Text as a full-width col
- iframe with col-8 width and 50vh height

------------------
- Bootstrap container-fluid element as a single row
- Each staff member is its own column, with a column width of 12 if window size
  is below the large breakpoint, and column width of 5 otherwise.
- Each staff member has a listed name, position, and email. Their images are
  individually made for the site, and a placeholder is used if the staff member
  does not wish to have a picture.
