------------------
    Services links
------------------
- Bootstrap carousel with 3 slides:
  - Slide 0
    - Hype links and FAQ formatted with Bootstrap
  - Slide 1
    - Bootstrap container-fluid element as a single row.
    - Each service is a column, the DJ service uses full width up top due to 
      popularity.
    - Other services are column width 10 if the window is below large 
      breakpoint, and column width 5 otherwise.
    - Proper sizing is reliant on images inside the service being 901x383 or of
      equivalent aspect ratio.
    - Image vanishes on hover to reveal text. User is assumed on desktop if
      above large breakpoint.
    - If below large breakpoint, a mobile client is assumed and text is shown
      under the image as well, since hovering is impossible on mobile.
  - Slide 2 (Bootstrap row)
    - Images for each room accompanied with a small description.
    - Alternates image/description on left/right for each column
    - 2 buttons
      - Photo Gallery
        - Launches a modal (popup) to display a photo gallery of the room
      - Book Now
        - Links to the room booking form
- Modal elements are outside the main carousel because nested carousels are
  unsupported. Having them outside makes the image carousels inside work

    Contact us ie staff list
------------------
- Bootstrap container-fluid element as a single row
- Each staff member is its own column, with a column width of 12 if window size
  is below the large breakpoint, and column width of 5 otherwise.
- Each staff member has a listed name, position, and email. Their images are
  individually made for the site, and a placeholder is used if the staff member
  does not wish to have a picture.
- Extra 10vmax on bottom margin because portrait canvases will cut off the 
  bottom of the list. don't know why.
